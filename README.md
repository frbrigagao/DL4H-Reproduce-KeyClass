# KeyClass: Text Classification with Label-Descriptions Only

This repository is an attempt at reproducing the paper [Classifying Unstructured Clinical Notes via Automatic Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12088) for the CS598 - Deep Learning for Healthcare class at UIUC Spring 2025. 

The original code for the paper was obtained from the authors' Github repository: https://github.com/autonlab/KeyClass

**This version includes modifications to attempt to support multi-label classification, specifically for the MIMIC-III dataset, as described in the paper but not included in the original code repository.**

# 2. Requirements

## 2.1 Hardware Requirements

The project was tested on Linux machines running Debian/Ubuntu, with a 32-core CPU, an RTX 4090 GPU 24GB, and at least 128-256 GB of RAM (256GB for some experiments).
MIMIC-III experiments, especially with larger models like BlueBERT, can be memory-intensive.

## 2.2 Environment Setup

First, have **CUDA 12.4+**  installed on the system. A guideline is available on the [Nvidia website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-4-0-download-archive). 

Install the `uv` python package manager, available at https://github.com/astral-sh/uv.

On Debian/Ubuntu, run this command to install the dependencies to compile the `slycot` package and to run R scripts (required for MIMIC dataset preprocessing):
``` shell
sudo apt install gfortran liblapack-dev libopenblas-dev
sudo apt install r-base r-base-dev
sudo apt install r-cran-stringr r-cran-data.table r-cran-dplyr r-cran-lubridate r-cran-caret r-cran-tibble
```
*(Note: If you encounter issues installing R packages via apt, you might need to install them within R itself using `install.packages(c("stringr", "data.table", ...))`)*

After the previous command completes, **within the project folder**, run:

- `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate the project's virtual environment.
- `uv sync` to install the necessary python packages. 

*If you want to use another python environment (conda or pip), the necessary packages are listed in the `pyproject.toml` file.*

In addition, this project supports [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/) for model training tracking. If you want to use this feature, please first create your account and authenticate with the API key using `uvx wandb login`.

## 2.3 Getting the Benchmark Datasets, Original Models, and Results

To download the **benchmark datasets** (imdb, amazon, agnews, dbpedia), original pre-trained models (for benchmarks), and results (for benchmarks), run this command:
```shell
cd scripts # Must be in the scripts folder 
uv run get_data.py
``` 

The script will ask for confirmation before dowloading each file. **Atention**: this script will **not** provide the MIMIC-3 dataset.

## 2.4 MIMIC-3 Dataset Preprocessing

KeyClass pipeline requires the MIMIC-III dataset to be preprocessed before running experiments using config_mimic.yml.

**Steps:**

1.**Obtain MIMIC-III**: You must obtain the MIMIC-III Clinical Database (v1.4 or compatible) through the official process (https://mimic.physionet.org/). This requires completing training and signing a data use agreement.

2.**Place Raw Files**: Copy the `DIAGNOSES_ICD.csv` and `NOTEEVENTS.csv` files from the MIMIC-III dataset into the `mimic_preprocessing/mimic_csv_files/` directory.

3.**Run R Script**: Execute the R script to process the raw CSVs and create intermediate files. This script joins diagnoses with discharge summaries and categorizes ICD-9 codes.
```shell
cd mimic_preprocessing # Navigate to the preprocessing directory
Rscript 01_create_admission_note_table.R
```
This will generate `icd9NotesDataTable_train.csv` and `icd9NotesDataTable_test.csv` in the `mimic_preprocessing/intermediate_files/` directory.

4.**Run Python Script**: Execute the Python script to convert the intermediate files into the final format required by the KeyClass pipeline (text files and multi-hot encoded labels).
```shell
cd mimic_preprocessing # Navigate to the preprocessing directory
uv run 02_generate_mimic_train_test_files.py
```
This will create the following files in the `mimic_preprocessing/output_mimic_files/` directory:
- `train.txt`: Training clinical notes (one per line).
- `test.txt`: Testing clinical notes (one per line).
- `train_labels.txt`: Multi-hot encoded labels for training data (e.g., "010...1").
- `test_labels.txt`: Multi-hot encoded labels for testing data.
- `labels.txt`: Names of the 19 top-level ICD-9 categories.

5.**Copy Output Files**: Copy the output files from the `mimic_preprocessing/output_mimic_files/` to `original_data/mimic` folder.

6.**Generate ICD-9 Descriptors (optional)**: The descriptors are already included in the `/config_files/config_mimic.yml`. However, if you want to manually generate them, run the following script:
```shell
cd mimic_preprocessing # Navigate to the preprocessing directory
uv run 00_generate_icd9_descriptors.py icd9_descriptions/CMS32_DESC_LONG_DX.txt --top_n 30 --output_file target_icd9_descriptors.txt 
```
The output file will be `target_icd9_descriptors.txt`.

# 3. Training

To train a single model with the configuration parameters established in the original paper (or modified for experiments), choose one of the `.yaml` configuration files in `/config_files/` (e.g., `config_imdb.yml` for IMDb or `config_mimic.yml` for MIMIC-III after preprocessing) and run this command:
``` shell
cd scripts # Need to be in the /scripts folder 
# Example for IMDB (use this for imdb, amazon, dbpedia, and agnews datasets - single label problems):
uv run run_all.py --config ../config_files/config_imdb.yml --use_wandb 1 # if Weights & Biases is set up
uv run run_all.py --config ../config_files/config_imdb.yml --use_wandb 0 # if Weights & Biases is NOT set up

# Example for MIMIC-III (ensure preprocessing is done first):
uv run run_all_multilabel_.py --config ../config_files/config_mimic.yml --use_wandb 1 # if Weights & Biases is set up
uv run run_all_multilabel.py --config ../config_files/config_mimic.yml --use_wandb 0 # if Weights & Biases is NOT set up
```

# 4. Ablations/Extensions

## 4.1 Experiment 1 - Testing different batch sizes and learning rates

This experiment tests various learning rates and batch sizes for the benchmark datasets.
```shell
cd scripts # Need to be in the /scripts folder 
uv run run_experiments_1.py --use_wandb --keep_configs # If you want Weights & Biases logging and to keep the temporary config files.
uv run run_experiments_1.py # Only local logs
```

**Attention**: This script might take **several days** to complete due to the number of experiments.

## 4.2 Experiment 2 - Testing different number of labeling functions for DBPedia dataset 

This experiment tests varying numbers of labeling functions (topk) for selected datasets (currently configured primarily for DBPedia).
```shell
cd scripts # Need to be in the /scripts folder
uv run run_experiments_2.py --use_wandb --keep_configs # If you want Weights & Biases logging and to keep the temporary config files.
# uv run run_experiments_2.py # Only local logs
```

# 5. Evaluation

Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1) is performed automatically at the end of the training process in `run_all.py` (specifically within `train_downstream_model.py`). 

Results are saved in the corresponding `results/<experiment_name>/metrics/` directory and logged to the console (and Weights & Biases if enabled).

# 6. Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models **for the benchmark datasets** using the `scripts/get_data.py` script (see Section 2.3).

# 7. Results

Reproducibility results compared to the original paper's will be documented here or in separate analysis files/reports as experiments complete.
